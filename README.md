# Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Project

## Goal
This assignment focuses on developing strong relational database design skills ðŸ§ ðŸ’¾. Working as a team, you will create a fully functional database for an e-commerce system, starting with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and ending with a complete SQL schema.

**Note:**  
This is an educational project intended for peer group collaboration.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements
- Brainstorm and prioritize essential features for the e-commerce platform.
- Identify core entities (Products, Customers, Orders) and define their relationships.
- Gather business rules and constraints to guide the database design.

### Phase 2: ERD Development
- Create an ERD to visualize entity connections.
- Assign primary keys (PKs) and foreign keys (FKs) to establish strong relationships.
- Review the design with stakeholders for feedback and validation.

### Phase 3: Schema Design
- Convert the ERD into a detailed relational schema (tables, columns, relationships).
- Normalize the schema to eliminate redundancy.
- Define appropriate data types and constraints to maintain data integrity.

### Phase 4: Database Implementation
- Write SQL scripts to create the database structure in the selected DBMS.
- Add indexes to optimize query performance.
- Insert sample data for initial testing.

### Phase 5: Testing, Optimization, and Final Preparation
- Conduct thorough testing for data integrity, performance, and rule enforcement.
- Optimize queries and refine the schema based on testing results.
- Prepare the database for scalability and future growth.
